# Minecraft-Terminal-Splash-Texts
A simple shell script to display a random Minecraft Splash Text in every opening of a terminal.

- There is a persistance system but it works only on bash, not in zsh -> a message will not change in the same terminal whatever the number of times you launch the script.
- Whether, you can enter "new" as an argument to have a new message but only the first message displayed will be displayed without the argument

# Brief setup instructions

This script needs the three files in the directory to work but you can place it anywere you want in your home and it will work.
To setup the script, a second script was made (setSplashToRcFiles.sh) and it add an execution on both bashrc and zshrc (if you have one of those of course).

### A better README will be write soon...
